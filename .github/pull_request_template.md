### Contributing

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

- [ ] The project was created by the developer born in Vietnam or self-indicate themself as Vietnamese.
- [ ] The project has more that 100 stars on Github (or good enough to be listed).

If they do, feel free to make a PR!

(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)
